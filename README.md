About This Repository:

This repository showcases a collection of beginner to intermediate-level frontend projects I built to sharpen my skills in web development. It includes:

1. Form Validation: A clean and responsive HTML/CSS form with JavaScript-based validation, demonstrating client-side data handling, error feedback, and UX principles.

2. Tic Tac Toe Game: A fully interactive two-player game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project emphasizes DOM manipulation, game logic implementation, and state management without the use of libraries or frameworks.

3. Calculator: A functional calculator app that supports basic arithmetic operations. It demonstrates my ability to create an interactive UI and handle user input with clean JavaScript logic.

These projects were built from scratch to reinforce my understanding of core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript). Each project is organized, readable, and documented to reflect real-world development practices such as modular coding, clear naming conventions, and code reusability. My goal with this repository is to demonstrate both technical capability and the motivation to learn and build independently.

Whether you're a recruiter looking for an enthusiastic developer or a fellow coder looking for inspiration, I hope this repository helps convey my passion for web development and problem-solving.
